<h1>Description</h1>
In this lab I am setting up a Active Directory (AD) environment in Azure. This environment will be the foundation of future Active Directory labs I will be diving into. The AD environment will have two Domain Controllers that will replicate each other, enabling a redundancy and high availbility incase one were to go offline. 

<h2>Utilities Used</h2>
- Azure: Used to host virtual machines and create a virtual network. </br>
- Windows Server 2022: Operating system that the Domain Controllers will be running. </br>
- Active Directory: Directory service used to create users and groups. </br>
- Group Policy: Used to allow Remote Desktop connections for users created in lab environment.
